## 1) Conceptual Question

This first question is conceptual and written responses are expected. For each item below, indicate whether the appropriate method would be classification or regression, and whether we are most interested in inference or prediction. Please include a written sentence or two explaining why you made this choice. Also, indicate what n and p are for each section.

| (a)  | A dataset contains data for 350 manufacturing companies in Europe. The following variables are included in the data for each company: industry, number of employees, salary of the CEO, and total profit. We are interested in learning which variables impact the CEO's salary.                                                                                                                                                                                            | We are most interested in ***inference*** because we want to infer or learn which variables impact the CEO's salary. In this case, the appropriate method would be regression because the dependent variable is continuous. | 350                   | Salary of the CEO (continuous float)                       | industry, number of employees, total profit                                                           |
| (b)  | A market research company is hired to help a startup analyze their new product. We want to know whether the product will be a success or failure. Similar products exist on the market so the market research company gathers data on 31 similar products. The company records the following data points about each previously launched product: price of the product, competition price, marketing budget, ten other variables, and whether or not it succeeded or failed. | We are interested in ***predicting*** whether or not a product will succeed or fail. We are interested in ***classifying*** a product as a potential success or failure.                                                    | 31                    | Whether the product will succeed or fail (binary variable) | product price, competition price, marketing budget, and the ten other variables                       |
| (c)  | Every week data is collected for the world stock market in 2012. The data points collected include the % change in the dollar, the % change in the market in the United States, the % change in the market in China, and the % change in the market in France. We are interested in predicting the % change in the dollar in relation to the changes every week in the world stock markets.                                                                                 | We are interested in ***predicting*** the %change in the dollar. Again, ***regression*** would be most appropriate because the dependent variable is continuous.                                                            | 52                    | % Change in the dollar (continuous float between 0-100)    | % change in the market in the U.S., % change in the market in China, % change in the market in France |
